        <h1>Meet the Commander</h1>
        <p id="primer">Kwain at the helm embodies both subtlety and strategic advantage. 
            At the cost of just Azorius mana, Kwain often flies under the radar in gameplay, rarely becoming the primary target of removal spells or counters. 
            His ability to facilitate card draw for all players each turn make him a unique commander. 
            This unassuming quality allows Kwain to quietly establish a powerful card draw engine that benefits all players at the table.</p>

            <p id="primer">His versatility is perhaps his greatest strength. By simply being on the battlefield, Kwain kickstarts the card draw engine without requiring any additional setup or resources while evading attention.
                This flexibility supports various strategies and deck archetypes, from control to group hug and everything in between. 
                Whether accelerating one's own card advantage or fostering political alliances through shared resources, Kwain can remain relevant at any point in the game.</p>
                
                <p id="primer">With all this in mind, we'll embrace the unpredictability of the type of deck that Kwain can support.
                    We'll do this by drawing as many cards as possible to craft the perfect hand to win the game.
