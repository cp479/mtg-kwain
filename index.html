        <h1>Meet the Commander</h1>
        <p id="primer">Kwain at the helm embodies both subtlety and strategic advantage. 
            At the cost of just Azorius mana, Kwain often flies under the radar in gameplay, rarely becoming the primary target of removal spells or counters. 
            His ability to facilitate card draw for all players each turn make him a unique commander. 
            This unassuming quality allows Kwain to quietly establish a powerful card draw engine that benefits all players at the table.</p>

            <p id="primer">His versatility is perhaps his greatest strength. By simply being on the battlefield, Kwain kickstarts the card draw engine without requiring any additional setup or resources while evading attention.
                This flexibility supports various strategies and deck archetypes, from control to group hug and everything in between. 
                Whether accelerating one's own card advantage or fostering political alliances through shared resources, Kwain can remain relevant at any point in the game.</p>
                
                <p id="primer">With all this in mind, we'll embrace the unpredictability of the type of deck that Kwain can support.
                    We'll do this by drawing as many cards as possible to craft the perfect hand to win the game.

        <h1>Gameplan - Key Cards, Cool Combos, and Win Conditions</h1>
        <p id="subtitle">These are cards to lookout for in-game both for yourself as the player and for opponents. Naturally as with any deck, if any of the cards below are countered or removed, it's a step back. 
            But because this deck is a combo deck, it's a much larger setback because you'll be building from scratch again with a new combo in mind. 
        Although these are the best cards to try and play, they are also its own greatest weakness because opponents can see the pieces come together and react accordingly. </p>
        <div class="card2">
            <img id="jincard" src="images/omniscience.jpg" width="223px" height="311px" border-radius="10px">
            <p id="jintext">This card is without a doubt your priorty. The deck has a pretty high mana curve, so casting this ensures you'll be able to cast as many cards as you can. 
                This will exponentially increase your odds of winning. There are a few cards in the deck that allow you to cheat high-mana costs, but
                this card is at the top of your decision-making tree; if this is in your hand, do anything it takes to cast it.

            <p id="jintext">One of the main win conditions is Approach of the Second Sun. 
                With the perfect setup, you can cast this card, draw seven cards, and cast it a second time all on the same turn.
                If not, then you should ideally draw enough cards by the time your next turn comes around. </p>

            <p id="jintext">A big weakness of the deck is that there is no recursion from the graveyard. 
                Once a card hits the graveyard, there is no way to bring it back. 
                If you know for sure that one of your cards will hit the graveyard in any way, use this to bring it back.
                Choose wisely and anticipate accordingly; holding up 1UUU is a lot of mana.

                Running efficient removal such as [Swords to Plowshares] is essential, while [Fierce Guardianship] ensures you always have a counterspell ready
                (Kwain as your commander is unlikely to be removed). Board wipes like [Farewell] stops anyone from getting way too ahead, 
                while [Time Stop] acts as your emergency button to prevent an opponent from winning the game before you do; sometimes all it takes is one more turn.
